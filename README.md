How to push to GitHub

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (via the website or `gh repo create`).
2. On your machine, in the project root run:

```powershell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin <YOUR_GIT_REMOTE_URL>
git push -u origin main
```

If you want me to create the GitHub repo and push it for you, I can do that if you grant access to your account (using the GitHub CLI `gh` configured) or provide a repository URL.
